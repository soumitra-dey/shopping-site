# Shopping Site
This is a basically a frontend based shopping application.

(N.B: I did not use backend so login id and password is hardcoded which I write below)

- UserId: user

- Password: user

## Live demo

## Functionality
- Login - logout (if user did not login user cannot access other page)
- Filter (All filter functionalities work perfectly)
- Add to cart (User can add to cart only one time and then increace and decrese the quantity)
- maintain quantity (user can not buy over the quantity or availability)
- Responsive pages (All pages are Responsive and support mobile and desktop screen both)
